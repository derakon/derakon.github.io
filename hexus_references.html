I'm working on a selection of aesthetic references to give to artists who are doing work on the game. Might as well share it here!<br>
<br>
Alright, overall game aesthetics. The game almost entirely takes place inside of cyberpunk corporate environments: warehouses, factories, laboratories, server rooms, etc. These are all environments with a purpose. You don't live in them, you work in them. So they're generally going to be cleaner than the outside world, with less random debris. One of the core aspects of cyberpunk is wealth inequality, and <i>during gameplay</i> we'll mostly be getting a very biased view of the game world. Cutscenes bracketing the gameplay can give a more nuanced view...conceivably, someday there might be gameplay "on the ground", but I don't have plans for that, currently.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at a few dystopic-future games, and I'll give commentary on them. First a note: my game uses an "internal resolution" of 480x270, which is point-upscaled to fit the player's display, to keep sharp pixels. 480x270 with a 4x upscale is 1920x1080. In-game, characters will be 24x32 pixels, to fit into the 24x24 square map tiles.<br>

<strong>Katana Zero:</strong><br>

<br>
​(640x360 resolution for core graphics, but they cheat the pixel size for lighting, particle effects, etc)<br>
<br>
<strong>​What I like:</strong> It's colorful. The environments are clean and sharp. The environments we see are mostly pretty clean; there's dirty city streets, but when we're inside, things are nicer/more expensive. Character sprites are stylized and have some strong shapes to them.<br>
<strong>What I don't:</strong> The cheating of pixel sizes. The lighting effects and general detail level probably aren't realistically attainable on my budget.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Chrono Trigger:</strong><br>

256x224 pixels, at least when people aren't using upscalers *shakes fist*<br>
<br>
<strong>What I like:</strong>&nbsp;Brightly-colored characters standing out against&nbsp;a desaturated background. Weird, fleshy alien monsters; chunky, asymmetrical robots. Contrast between messy, ruined exteriors, and clean, sharp interiors.<br>
<br>
<br>
Batman (NES):<br>

<br>
<strong>What I like:</strong> The stark lighting, with things fading into black. Chunky, abstract machinery. <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Timespinner:</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>What I don't like:</strong> the character graphics feel very "soft". There's a lack of contrast and hard edges, which makes the screenshots feel kind of dull.<br>
<br>
<strong>MegaSphere:</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>What I like:</strong> Contrast between brightly-lit / neon elements and an otherwise mostly darker environment. Good use of color in general. <br>
<strong>What I don't:</strong> Those turbo-saturated neon colors are quickly going to get tiring to look at. Perhaps a little <i>too</i> dark at points.<br>
<br>
<strong>Cyber-Shadow:</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>What I like:</strong> basically an evolved version of Batman, aesthetically. Bright colors standing out against darkness; shading with black.
